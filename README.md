# OPAL

Opal is a web application I developed along with 3 classmates for my SaaS class. Opal is a video streaming platform dedicated for amateur student filmmakers to publish their content, interact with other filmmakers, and gain visibility. It being specifically for student films allows for content discoverability without being obstructed by more popular genres and content on a general video streaming platform like YouTube.

# PROJECT FEATURES:
Opal consists of the following complete features: 
- a landing page
- a user signup and login screens
- a user profile page which lists films uploaded by the user
- a home page where you can browse posts by other users and filter by school
- a video player screen that allows you to watch a video 
- a comment section for each video
