# 

Opal is a web application I developed along with 3 classmates for my SaaS class using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. 

Opal is a video streaming platform dedicated for amateur student filmmakers to publish their content and interact with other filmmakers. It solves the problem of amaeteur filmmakers having to fight for content visibility on popular platforms like YouTube. The main goals we had for Opal was to be both a video upload/streaming platform but also have social media aspects such as user interactivity.

# PROJECT FEATURES:
Opal consists of the following complete features: 
- Model, View, Controller structure
- a landing page

- a comment section for each video
- BDD and TDD tests
